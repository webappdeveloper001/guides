# Unicode to Binary Conversion Reference

## Basic Unicode to Binary Table (U+0000 to U+007F)

This table shows the first 128 Unicode code points (matching ASCII) with their binary representations:

| Character | Unicode Code Point | Binary (8-bit) |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
|           | U+0000 (0)         | `00000000`     |
| ☺         | U+0001 (1)         | `00000001`     |
| ☻         | U+0002 (2)         | `00000010`     |
| ...       | ...                | ...            |
| ~         | U+007E (126)       | `01111110`     |
| ⌂         | U+007F (127)       | `01111111`     |

## Key Notes

- **Coverage**: This table includes the first 128 Unicode code points (U+0000 to U+007F) which align with ASCII
- **Extended Unicode**: Characters beyond U+007F require multi-byte UTF-8 encoding:
  - Example: `é` (U+00E9) → UTF-8 binary: `11000011 10101001` (2 bytes)
- **Control Characters**: Non-printable characters (U+0000 to U+001F) are included for completeness

```text
Example UTF-8 encoding for 'é':
Unicode: U+00E9
UTF-8:  11000011 10101001
```
